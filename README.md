# Dementia Detection Based on Speech Transcript Analysis
The project titled "Dementia Detection Based on Speech Transcript Analysis" using DementiaBank with Pitt Corpus focuses on utilizing natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to detect early signs of dementia by analyzing speech patterns. Key components include text analysis, grammatical pattern analysis, and parts of speech ratio analysis to identify linguistic irregularities and cognitive decline. The project extracts various linguistic features such as sentence complexity and word frequency and employs supervised learning algorithms using tools like Python, NLTK, TensorFlow, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to classify speech transcripts. Additionally, Matplotlib and other visualization tools help present insights and trends, enhancing the interpretability of the results and aiding in early dementia diagnosis.
